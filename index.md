I am a third year Computer Engineering Student at **UCSD** with *possibly* too many interests. 

## I have experience with:
- Python
- C
- C++
- Java
- HTML

I've also taken classes in computer architecture and circuits. 

Outside of coding, I like to write, play music, knit, and read.

I also like clowns.

They are very fun to draw.

## Current Projects
- [ ] Knitting Pattern Preview
- [ ] Irish Folk Song Search
